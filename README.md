# Overview

I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is simple and just runs in the console. The user plays against the computer, which is a simple random choice alogorithm. The computer keeps selecting random spots until it finds an empty spot on the game board. The user and computer go back and forth until someone wins or the baord is full. The game then prompts the user if they would like to play again.

I designed this software in order to gain a better understanding of the Kotlin language. I wanted a fun goal as I was learning Kotlin. This game did the trick.
